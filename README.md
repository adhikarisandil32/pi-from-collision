# About

This is just an experimentation based off of a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs) where two boxes whose masses are in the ratio of `100^n` go on a perfectly elastic collision. Large box colides left small to the left and then the left box goes off to strike wall on left-most.

Provide the value of number of digits of pi you want and then hit start (recommended to use number below or equal to 5).
